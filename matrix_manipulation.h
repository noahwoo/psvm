  //   After the original matrix is loaded (assume a n-by-p matrix), an
  // incremental incomplete cholesky factorization is performed, which expands
  // the original n-by-p matrix to a (n+n_plus)-by-(p+p_plus) matrix. n_plus
  // is the number of added samples provided by 'doc', p_plus is the number of
  // columns need to be attached to the original matrix. If n and p are zeros,
  // an ordinary incomplete cholesky factorization is performed.

  // matrix element is required, it is calculated based on corresponding
  // samples (provided by 'doc', or broadcasted from other machines),
  // kernel parameters ('kernel').
  //
  // The resulting ICF matrix is stored in 'icf', which is distributed by rows.
